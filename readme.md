OpenComments
============

A light, effective user comments composer package that is easy to configure and implement.

OpenComments quickly integrates a fully-functional comments system under your content on any page. It is authorization class agnostic and can be adjusted in the config file to suit your website's authentication library. By default, Laravel 4's basic auth function is used.

With OpenComments, you can easily add the ability for comments to appear under many different areas of your site. By simply setting `contentType` and `contentID` javascript variables on your page before you load the `open-comments::comments` view, OpenComments will save the type of content it appears under as well. This can be useful if you have a Blog as well as other areas of the website that require comments.

Please keep in mind all of the above in the description will be true and working as described, but the project is currently in a very early phase. At this point, use is not recommended, but please check back soon.
